/**
 * <p>
 * This class provide an abstraction level for the concept "artifact" in carbon.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An artifact can be considered as a thing to deploy in carbon.
 * Eg: webapp, service, jaggery-app, proxy-service, sequence, spi, endpoint
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each artifact is associated with a deployer, which can process and deploy it to the relevant
 * runtime configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An artifact will have a unique identifier (key), which can be used for artifact identification
 * within a runtime.
 * </p>
 * An artifact can have custom properties that are needed for relevant runtime environment.
